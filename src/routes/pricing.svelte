				Not ready to offer online ordering? No problem! With our Standard Plan, you get an online
				menu that looks great on every device and replaces paper menus with QR codes. Use this
				feature to update your menu anytime without having to reprint, and it only takes a few steps
				to enable online ordering when you're ready.
