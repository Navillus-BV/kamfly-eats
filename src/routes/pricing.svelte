				At Kamfly, we think restaurants should be able to offer online ordering without sacrificing
				their margins. Some of our competitors charge fees up to 15% of total sales... We think your
				business deserves better.

			<p>
				We know that this is a tough time to be in the restaurant business. That's the whole reason
				we started Kamfly - to help as many restaurants as possible keep their doors open through
				this mess.
			</p>
			<p>
				So... Until things start to pick back up, we will not be charging any monthly base fees.
				That's a savings of $25/month on our Standard Plan or $100/month on our Pro Plan! Check out
				our pricing page to learn more and see how you can get started.

				Not ready to offer online ordering? No problem! With our Standard Plan, you get an online
				menu that looks great on every device and replaces paper menus with QR codes. Use this
				feature to update your menu anytime without having to reprint, and it only takes a few steps
				to enable online ordering when you're ready.
