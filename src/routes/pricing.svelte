		We know that this is a tough time to be in the restaurant business. That's the whole reason we
		started Kamfly - to help as many restaurants as possible keep their doors open through this
		mess.
	</p>
	<p>
		So... Until things start to pick back up, we will not be charging any monthly base fees. That's
		a savings of $25/month on our Standard Plan or $100/month on our Pro Plan! Check out our pricing
		page to learn more and see how you can get started.

		Not ready to offer online ordering? No problem! With our Standard Plan, you get an online menu
		that looks great on every device and replaces paper menus with QR codes. Use this feature to
		update your menu anytime without having to reprint, and it only takes a few steps to enable
		online ordering when you're ready.
