            <h2>How the price comparisons are calculated</h2>
            <p>Price comparisons are based on the latest publicly available pricing data.</p>

            <h3>Kamfly</h3>
            <p>Our prices are calculated based on our
                <a href="/pricing/#plans">Pro Plan</a>
                - $100 monthly base fee + a 2% transaction fee.</p>
            <p>For a limited time, due to COVID-19, we are waiving our monthly base fee - so all you pay are the 2% transaction fees.</p>

            <h3>Thuisbezorgd</h3>
            <p>Thuisbezorgd charges 13% of total sales through their platform, there is no additional monthly fee. They increased their rates to 13% in 2019 but annouced that they
                <a href="https://twinklemagazine.nl/2019/08/jitse-groen-commissie/index.xml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">have no plans</a>
                to increase rates further.</p>

            <h3>Uber Eats</h3>
            <p>For all pickup orders or orders using a restaurant's own delivery drivers,
                <a href="https://restaurants.ubereats.com/us/en/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Uber Eats charges 15%</a>
                of total sales through their platform. An additional 15% is charged when restaurants opt-in to use Uber Eats' delivery service - we did not include the additional 15% fee in this comparison since we do not offer a comparable delivery service.</p>

            <h3>A note about payment processing fees:</h3>
            <p>These are fees charged by the company/companies you use to process your customers' payments (e.g. Square, Visa, iDeal). These are not included in Kamfly's pricing, because the actual fees vary from processor to processor.</p>

                for more details on the supported payment processors/gateways. Payment processing fees vary by region and type of payment, but in general you can expect a per transaction fee of less than €0.50 and a fee of 1-3% for credit cards.</p>
