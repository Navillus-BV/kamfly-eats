            <p>Price comparisons are based on the latest publicly available pricing data.</p>

            <h3>Kamfly</h3>
            <p>Our prices are calculated based on our
                <a href="/pricing/#plans">Pro Plan</a>. Payment gateways are not included in the comparison estimate as they depend on the payment processor and payment service used.

                for more details on the supported payment gateways. Payment gateway fees vary by region and type of payment, in general you can expect a per transaction fee of less than €0.50 and a fee of 1-3% for credit cards.</p>

            <h3>Thuisbezorgd</h3>
            <p>Thuisbezorgd charges 13% of total sales through their platform, there is no additional monthly fee. They increased their rates to 13% in 2019 but annouced that they

                to increase rates further.</p>

            <h3>Uber Eats</h3>
            <p>For all pickup orders or orders using a restaurant's own delivery drivers,
                <a href="https://restaurants.ubereats.com/us/en/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Uber Eats charges 15%</a>
                of total sales through their platform. An additional 15% is charged when restaurants opt-in to use Uber Eats' delivery service - we did not include the additional 15% fee in this comparison since we do not offer a comparable delivery service.</p>
